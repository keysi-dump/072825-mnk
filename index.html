                <p>Hi my baby,</p>

                <p>
                    Can you believe it's already been a month? A month of corny jokes, late-night calls, giggles, and
                    sponty
                    trips. I never thought I'd be this soft, but here we are — you made me like this!! 😭💗
                </p>

                <p>
                    I know we’re miles apart, but every time you smile at your screen, I feel it. Every time you say my
                    name, it echoes here in my tiny heart (ok that was dramatic but true 🤣). You're my favorite
                    notification, my favorite face, and my favorite “I miss you.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    I poured my whole cheesy soul into this little site — kahit di pa ako pro coder, I wanted you to
                    feel
                    just how much I care about you. This is me, being silly, being sincere, and being completely,
                    undeniably
                    in love with you. 🥹💘
                </p>

                <p>
                    So please remember this: wherever you are, no matter how far, there's a girl who’s smiling at her
                    screen
                    right now, supporting and thinking of you. And she's not going anywhere.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I know I can be makulit, madaldal, and annoying sometimes (or most of the time 😅), but thank you
                    for
                    staying. Please wait for me while I work on myself — I’m doing my best to be more stable, more
                    ready,
                    and more present… for you. 🫶
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’ll try to understand you more, support you better, and love you in all the ways I know how — in
                    real
                    life, and in HTML 😭💗
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you for being my first best boyfie. And hopefully, my last. If everything gets blurry, let's
                    always meet halfway, my love, okay?
                </p>

                <p class="love-signature">
                    Love always,<br>
