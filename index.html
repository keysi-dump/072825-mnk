        <p>Hi my baby,</p>
        <p>
          Can you believe it's already been a month? A month of corny jokes, late-night calls, and sponty trips. I never thought I'd be this soft, but here we are â€” you made me like this!! ðŸ˜­ðŸ’—
        </p>
        <p>
          Still on cloud 9 bc I never expected that we'll be together like this. Sabi nga nila, expect the unexpected, thanks God I made the right choice of choosing u despite of having tons of doubts back then.
        </p>
        <p>
          I poured my whole cheesy soul into this little site â€” kahit di pa ako pro coder, I wanted you to feel just how much I care about you. This is me, being silly, being sincere, and being completely, in love with you (CHAROT ANG CORNY HAHAHA). ðŸ¥¹ðŸ’˜
        </p>
        <p>
          So please remember this: wherever you are, no matter how far, there's a girl whoâ€™s smiling at her screen right now, supporting and thinking of you. And she's not going anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know I can be makulit, madaldal, and annoying sometimes (or most of the time ðŸ˜…), but thank you for staying. Please wait for me while I work on myself â€” Iâ€™m doing my best to be more stable, more ready, and more presentâ€¦ for us and u ðŸ«¶
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ll try to understand you more, support you better, and love you in all the ways I know how â€” i hope you too.. kahit matampuhin ka hehe!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for being my first best boyfie. And hopefully, my last. If everything gets blurry, let's always meet halfway. To more sponty trips soon, let's work hard together okie? I love you!
        </p>
